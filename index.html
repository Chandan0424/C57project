            because you don't need to put that much effort only workout your mind and use your fingers but it is one thing i am sure every one likes but only the smart and the experienced excel. The pro ones can join esports meaning a contest or chaampionship for each game (not all games) in which you will get money or not based on your rank in the leaderboard or you just have to win the championship to get the money.
